At home, my hypervisor of choice is Proxmox, and I generally go for Ubuntu when I need a VM. To keep things simple, I prefer running services in Docker when I can.

Professionally, my work has been on RHEL, managing services (Apache, MySQL), languages (PHP), and applications (WordPress, phpMyAdmin, PMWiki).

Feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you're interested in work like this.
