## Highlights

- designed, developed, and published an open-source desktop app
- learned Vue and Electron
- got dark mode working ðŸ˜Ž

## Contribution

As this was a personal project, all design and development was done by myself.

## Opportunity

On February 8, 2019, I found myself with a problem.

I had several tasks to complete across work, school, and my personal life. Some of them big, some of them small. I wanted to know how long I had to complete each of them, so I could prioritize accordingly. While there are plenty of apps that help us make lists, there were none at the time (that I knew of) that count down to a due date.

Around the same time, a friend of mine was creating an Electron app for a school project. This friend was also a Vue fan, while I was only familiar with React. I've always enjoyed learning new things, so creating my first desktop app while also trying out Vue sounded like a good time to me.

## Outcome

[Forecast](https://forecast.macguire.me) is a cross-platform desktop app to help manage tasks.

  content="Add tasks to your to-do list, and Forecast shows you the time remaining until each one is due."

That's really all there is to it.
