summary: "Vancouver Coastal Health trains around 1000 new staff per year, but the training registration process was severely inefficient. To modernize the workflow, I worked alongside the Clinical Education and Recruitment Services teams to design and develop a web app to automate each employeeâ€™s schedule and manage education sessions. The new process saves over 750 hours of labour each year."
